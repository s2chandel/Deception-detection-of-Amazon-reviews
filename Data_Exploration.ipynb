Copyright � 1964 by Gustav Fischer Verlag Stuttgart. Portions of the book appeared in Natural History magazine in April 1967 and is reprinted here with permission. The 15 plates and 12 text figures in this volume were drawn by Gerolf Steiner. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago 60637 The University of Chicago Press, Ltd., London.<br /><br />Maggie Koerth-Baker recently wrote a blog post about the book; the picture she refers to can be found by googling Maggie Koerth-Baker imaginary animals.<br /><br />&#34;In this dusty display box at the University of Maine sits the carefully preserved skeleton of a small, shrew-like rodent which, lacking hind legs, propelled itself along with the help of a long, jointed nose-foot. If that seems a bit too whimsical to be true, well, it is. The creature belongs to the mammalian order Rhinogradentia – an entirely made-up class of animals. Like this specimen, which belongs to UMaine professor Irving Kornfield, the rhinogrades are all rodents and they all have some sort of fantastic nasal appendage ... and, most importantly, none of them actually exist.<br /><br />&#34;Now, there are plenty of imaginary animals in the world and, some of them – like the jackalope, for instance – exist in taxidermy and skeletal form despite not existing as living beings. But most of those are folk-crafts, their origins steeped in tall tales or intentionally profitable efforts to mislead, and their inventors lost to time. Rhinogradentia, on the other hand, is relatively new. It was created in 1961 by a real German zoologist named Gerolf Steiner who wanted to illustrate the way evolution can create diversity in isolated populations. In order to do that, Steiner created a fake German zoologist called Harald Stümpke, a fake island chain called Hy-yi-yi, and a fake order of mammals with funny noses. And then he wrote a book about it.<br /><br />&#34; Published under Stümpke's name, The Snouters: Form and Life of the Rhinogrades, is meant to read like a totally serious zoology handbook of the time period. It's a parody that absolutely refuses to wink at you, and it's become a bit of an in-joke among biologists. This particular specimen was actually built by Kornfield, himself, using real animal bones and illustrations from Stümpke/Steiner's book.&#34;<br /><br />I enjoyed reading the book, and enjoyed reading both Maggie Koerth-Baker's description and the marvelous Reviews here on Amazon even more. My only problem is how to dispose of the book, now that I am down sizing my life.<br /><br />Robert C. Ross<br />March 2015\",\n",

When you buy the latest LG, Sony, or any other LCD, LED, or Plasma display, the speakers are always on the back and very tinny with little bass response.  In short, the television manufacturers do not expect you to actually use the speakers in the TV.  Many diehard audiophiles will decide to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on stereo receivers hooked up to surround sound speakers.  For those with lots of money, space, and the time to set it up, these home theaters can be great.  For the rest of us, we want quality sound from our televisions that is compact and easy to setup.  This is the place where the Sound Bar really shines.<br /><br />There are many brands with some similarities - you typically get a long speaker to go under the TV itself, either on its own stand or mounted on the wall.  There is also a separate sub-woofer for deep noise response.<br /><br />This Sony HTCT260 was an upgrade to my existing Sony HTCT100.  Despite similar names, they are quite different.  To start, the Sony HTCT100 was a total of 250W of sound - three 50W speakers in the bar and a 100W subwoofer.  The Sony HTCT260 is 300W - two 85W front speakers and a 130W subwoofer.  Whether the front is two or three speakers is immaterial - they are all inside a single bar.<br /><br />The Sony HTCT100 had a subwoofer that plugged into the wall, and the audio from the source plugged into the subwoofer.  Then the Sound Bar plugged into the subwoofer with a proprietary cable.  That meant the subwoofer had to be near the sound bar.  However, it also meant that the subwoofer was a receiver in itself, with HDMI pass thru, analog input, and optical input.  HDMI pass-thru means you can plug your Blu-Ray player into the subwoofer, and then plug the subwoofer into the TV.  It had multiple HDMI inputs so the Sony HTCT100 could switch between sources.<br /><br />The Sony HTCT260 does away with the HDMI select capability - in fact, it doesn\\'t have HDMI input at all, and the inputs are on the sound bar, not the sub-woofer.  The sub-woofer is a remote wireless device, so it can be placed anywhere, a major bonus.  It is shorter than the HTCT100 subwoofer, despite being more watts, is easier to conceal.  The only inputs are on the bar itself, consisting of Analog, Coaxial, and Optical.  Why did they make this change?  Consider my use of the HTCT100.  When I bought a TV that had networking capability, it meant that half the time I was using my TV, it was for content from the TV itself.  Since my TV had lots of HDMI inputs, it meant every device could also plug into the TV.  I eventually stopped using the HDMI passthrough and just plugged the optical out from my TV into the HTCT100.<br /><br />Since I assume most people have similar televisions now, the removal of the HDMI inputs and the wireless subwoofer of the HTCT260 makes sense.<br /><br />In terms of style, the sound bar is sharp looking, a little longer and wider than the HTCT100, and with a built-in display, it looks really good in my TV setup.  There are touch sensitive input select and volume buttons on the front, so you can adjust it even if you lose the remote control.<br /><br />Most important, how does it sound?  In a word, amazing.  I was dubious that the extra 50W would mean anything, but I found the sound far more immersive and expansive than with the HTCT100.  Previously on the HTCT100, I had actually hit the MAX and still thought the sound was too quiet for some sources, but now I can crank up the volume and actually get it too loud.  The bass is full and can be felt, but is not overpowering.  Simple \"sound field\" buttons on the remote allow you to adjust the effect for movies, games, or music.  With the subwoofer placed in the back of the room, I can achieve most of the surround sound effect without having to run wires and place tons of speakers.<br /><br />Finally, pairing the speaker with my iPhone via Bluetooth couldn\\'t be simpler.  I hit \"Pairing\" on the remote, and about 30 seconds later I was blasting Tchaikovsky through the speakers from the iPhone.<br /><br />Highly recommended - I\\'m sure you could get better sound with a more expensive system, but bang for the buck, I am totally happy with this sound bar and highly recommend you get one to go with your new television set.',\n",

Everyone knows that, but no one will believe that she's been clean for over six months, ever since her parents sent her to her aunt's for a tough love DIY rehab. But no matter what she says, no one believes the OXY pills--- the pills they found in her coat the night she and her best friend Mina walked into the woods together and only Sophie made it out alive --- aren’t hers. With everyone from her parents to Mina's brother believing that Mina was shot at a drug deal gone bad, it's up to Sophie to find the real motive and the real killer.<br /><br />But as she solves the case, Sophie has other issues to deal with, like the combined grief of her best friend's death and the knowledge that though they were both in love, Mina would have never agreed to be with her openly. Complicating things is her attraction to Mina's brother, who has always loved her and is responsible for the car accident that left her in permanent pain and led to her pill addiction. Joining forces with the strange but kind home-school kid who found her and Mina, Mina's ex-boyfriend and Mina's brother, Sophie begins to uncover the cold case that will lead her to solve two town murders.<br /><br />FAR FROM YOU is one part murder mystery, one part painful love story. Told in chapters that alternate between the present and the three most important times of her life --- the car crash, her pill addiction, and Mina's shooting --- it leaves plenty of mysteries unsolved until the final chapters. Sharpe does a great job as painting Sophie's love for Mina as another kind of addiction, an ever-present force in her life she could never really be free of, even as it was hurting her.<br /><br />FAR FROM YOU is a great book for fans of Veronica Mars, yet easily sets itself apart from the trend of YA murder mysteries with its unique love triangle and authentic voice of a teen dealing with addiction.<br /><br />Reviewed by Molly Horan on April 9, 2014.\",\n",

       " ('One lazy day I wondered into my local neighborhood music shop. Nothing in particular on my mind. Really just burning time on a Tuesday afternoon. I looked around a bit. This particular shop featured a large selection of Dean acoustics. Now, I was in High School in the late 80\\'s, early 90\\'s and at that time Dean guitars were considered to be something of a joke as far as electric guitars went. They were these wild, outrageous, ridiculous shapes and sizes. I remember reading an article in which some no name critic or 3rd string writer called Dean\\'s line-up \\'ghetto-ized\\'. I thought that was cute, filed it away in 13 and went on about life not giving any serious thought to Dean guitars. Mind you, I\\'m a kid with a summer job and not a lot of dollars or sense but even I, in my all knowing 17 year old wisdom, could pick up a Dean electric guitar and immediately tell it was complete garbage. It was terribly heavy, the stupid shapes made it impossible to sit down and play these guitars, the action was a country mile high, the \\'whammy\\' was made of sub-par materials, No one I knew owned one and none of the members of my favorite bands of the day played one, not even a custom built one. So I wasn\\'t expecting anything special when I walked into the local neighborhood music store that lazy Tuesday afternoon.<br /><br />  The selection that day was of the usual fair. A pretty black orchestral with ocher bindings (I was really into that one when I saw it, looked at buying it with serious intent). A \\'natural\\' dred. A red quilted ash, etc. etc. Then, at the end of a long rack of hanging guitars, there she was, my \\'Christine\\' of guitars. The object of my desire. The most lovely and unique looking guitar I had ever laid eyes on. I was immediately overcome by feelings of emptiness and despair and melancholy. I HAD TO HAVE THIS GUITAR!!! But first, I had to find out if Dean had the player in mind and had a decent action out of the box or was I gonna have to rebuild it so it plays worth anything. Happy to report that the action was very favorable with its factory light gauge strings. Now, I knew the very first thing I was gonna do was take those crap D\\'Addario\\'s off and replace them with Elixir Phosphor Bronze Nano Web Mediums. So I strung it, took it back, they adjusted it a little too low, couldn\\'t overcome a buzz. Took it back, had it adjusted again and viola! The guitar plays very well, IMO. Now, I had a cheap Chinese built Jay Turser G/A that was made of all Catalpa wood. That guitar had a deep, rich, warm sound that was absolutely intoxicating, especially after putting the Elixirs on it because they helped bring the mids and highs up to snuff. Oh how I absolutely adored that guitar. It was like coming home to an old dog that\\'s so happy to see you since you\\'ve come back from the mailbox. Like a hot bowl of chili on a snowy winters day. That guitar was as warm as a mothers hug. Used to lay flat on my back in bed with the body of that cheap guitar flat on my chest just banging out chord progressions and feeling that deep vibration resonate through my chest cavity. I don\\'t have that guitar in my life right now and I\\'m working like the devil to get it back. In the interim, I\\'m dying to grab up another G/A style guitar, that\\'s when I spotted \\'Christine\\'. Her sound, due to the difference in wood I reckon, is decidedly not warm, deep and rich. When I put the first strum to her, honestly, I was a little disappointed only because I have such limited experience with acoustic guitars, I was under the impression that the shape of the guitar was mainly responsible for the tone. WRONG! I was looking for that warmth I had felt with my last G/A. It wasn\\'t quite there. This guitar rings very bright and you have to work to get the low end to come through.<br /><br />  As I spend more time with it and play it more and more, I\\'m beginning to come around to it\\'s aural intricacies. I even took the initiative to go on Ebay and order a vinyl \\'Tree Of Life\\' mixed abalone decal from Creative Cutz that runs the length of the neck. IMO, the best tree of life decal available online, really makes that beautiful guitar \"POP\" more than it already does. Also, I considered the painted rosette to be rather drab for such a superstar beauty of an instrument so I went to inlay sticker and bought an ocher rosette inlay decal that very closely matches the ocher binding on the guitar. Finally, I went back to Ebay and and bought a set of D\\'Andrea Brass Tone Pins in mixed abalone that match the \\'Tree Of Life\\' on the neck.<br /><br />  Now, when I saw these things I thought they would look really neat, much better than the cheap white plastic pins from Dean. Again, being a general novice with acoustic guitars, I really have no idea what makes a guitar sound the way it sounds. Different woods, body styles, bracing and so on will effect the tone of the guitar, of course. Past that, no idear. As I stated previously, I was coming around to the sound of this guitar. Zebrawood is just gonna produce a sound thats much brighter than that Catalpa wood guitar. Then, I put in my D\\'Andrea Tone Pins and HOLY MOTHER OF PEARL DID THAT GUITAR COME ALIVE!!!!! I had absolutely no idea that the pins that hold the bottom of the strings in the bridge would have such a massive effect on tone. Almost seemed like an after thought to me. Boy was I wrong! Totally changed the tone and sustain. I immediately notice sound frequencies that were totally buried with the plastic pins. I had read various \\'opinions\\' on whether the pins are a scam or not and whether they have any effect on tone. They are not a scam. Much much happier to pick that guitar up and strum it now. They brought out the lows that I\\'ve been craving so much and mixed them with mids that make it sound like a different instrument entirely. If you have any type of ear for sound at all, you will notice a remarkable improvement in tonal expansion, richness and depth. This may sound like an exaggeration but it reallyis reminiscent of a twelve string acoustic. As soon as I started strumming with those pins and heard the difference, I started searching for the cause of this phenomenon. In my search I discovered that a new nut and saddle, professionally built and installed from top quality bone material will further serve to increase tonality, thats what comes next.<br /><br />  In conclusion, these guitars a first beautiful. Second, built well. My neck is straight and there are no  dips or waves in the wood on the body. And third, they have massive potential for improvement in tone and playability.',\n",

What a cleaver way to manage drops!! You just need to understand how to use it. One tip I can tell you is this: while dropping, try to keep the bottle in a straight vertical position (South direction or 270 degree). Do not tilt it. Do not shake it. Just keep it in this position and patiently wait for the drop to gradually falls. Also, do not hold the baby's mouth until you actually see the drop &#34;about&#34; to come off. Practice a few times and you will catch the right timing as when to hold your baby's mouth so the baby won't get frustrated from holding her/his mouth for longer time.<br /><br />A great product!! Good luck!\",\n",

I wanted to protect my camera from nicks and scratches since I regularly bring my camera on my hikes -- and this skin does a good job of it.<br /><br />Pros<br />----<br />- Protection<br />The skin is very thick, which will not only protect the camera from nicks and scratches but help dampen the impact from bumps. (The thick skin does make the already large 7D a little pudgy.)<br /><br />- Durable<br />The skin\\'s held up very well to all the frequent handling I subject it. There are no rips, tears, or any form of degradation. The previous skin I got for my Canon XSi held up to years of heavy use. This one looks to be equally durable.<br /><br />- Accurate Cutouts<br />The cutouts (for the screen, mode dial, lens mount, battery compartment, etc.) line up perfectly. Unlike my previous skin, this one lets me change lenses easily because the skin doesn\\'t obstruct the area where the lens meets the mount.<br /><br />Cons<br />----<br />- Hard Screen Protector Slides Around<br />I\\'m worried the hard screen protector does more harm than good since it slides around and could potentially scratch the LCD screen (even if the LCD had a regular \"soft\" screen protector on since the very edges of the LCD aren\\'t covered). Forget the Hard Screen Protector; a regular screen protector (included) will do the job just fine.<br /><br />- Buttons Not Clearly Labeled<br />This problem seems specific to only the skins for certain camera models. On the 7D, the labels on the buttons are imprinted as part of the molding, but they are barely legible.<br /><br />---<br />The Bottom Line: The Delkin Snug-it Pro is a well-made and durable product that offers the camera very good protection. The only shortcoming (for the skin for the Canon 7D) is the labels for the buttons are not clearly labelled (not a problem for me personally because I already know my way around the camera).',\n",

The art easel, fish aquarium, round rug, hamster wheel, table/chairs, and slide are all items that make up a great preschool setting!<br /><br />The magical color rug doesn't really teach colors but sounds of each musical instrument which can be combined with pressing one other band instrument. The center of the rug is the teachers voice where she asks different questions and has a short conversation with you like; &#34;It's time for Ms. Hugs magical rug! what can you find? Come back soon!&#34;<br /><br />I didn't rate it 5 stars because although it states on the box over 35 sounds, phrases and songs, it seems half that amount.

It has a red light (actually two LED bulbs), two white light intensity settings, and a flashing bright white light setting.  It is quite bright, more than bright enough, even on the lower brightness setting, for use illuminating a local area when I am doing some home repair.  It also comes with a flashing green following light (a small green LED located at the back of the battery pack) that someone can use to follow someone wearing the headlamp.<br /><br />Pros -<br />· The lamp can be adjusted to give a direct ahead beam or a beam that is tilted down to light the ground immediately ahead or when using it for repair work to direct the beam to the correct location.<br />· The unit comes with lithium batteries.<br />· The red light is useful for dark adaptation and for hunting animals that are not sensitive to red light.<br />· The lower intensity white light increases the battery life.  The flashing bright light setting also increases the battery life, while still giving the maximum brightness.<br />· The unit has a flashing green following light, located on the battery pack, which is useful when the light is used with a group of people walking on a trail.<br /><br />Cons -<br />· The battery pack is located at the back of the headband and is very bulky.  This prevented wearing the unit under a hardhat and I could not use it on top of my hardhat as it slipped off.<br />· Since I do not use the headlight for leading people along a trail, I found the following light to be a battery waster.  Unfortunately there is no switch to turn this feature off.  The manufacturer states that the following lamp draws very little power, but even a little is too much when the lamp is sitting unused in my workshop for months at a time. I had to open the battery pack and remove a battery to break the circuit in order to turn it off when the lamp was not in use.When I replaced the battery the following light was turned off.  There is, however, no way to turn off the following light when the headlamp is in use.<br /><br />All in all, this is the headlamp that I use around the house when I need a local \"hands free\" light.  When I finish using the headlamp I have to use the approach described above to turn off the following lamp, which I find to be not only annoying, but I am afraid that constantly having to open and close the battery pack will lead to an eventual failure of the closure clasp.

Colin Firth plays Stanley Crawford who is a famous magician who goes by the name and disguise of Wei Ling Soo.  Stanley is approached by his good friend and fellow magician, Howard Burkan (Simon McBurney) to go to England and help him expose a supposed medium who he believes is hoodwinking the wealthy Catledge family into investing a fortune into an organization that promotes supernatural contact with the deceased.<br /><br />Stanley agrees, but like Howard, has a hard time finding the secrets.  In fact, he becomes convinced that the young American, Sophie (Emma Stone) is the real deal after she advances secrets about himself.  Marcia Gay Harden plays Sophie\\'s mother, but really doesn\\'t have much to do.  Jacki Weaver plays Grace Catledge, the widow who is trying to contact her late husband.  Hamish Linklater plays Brice Catledge, the playboy son who is smitten with Sophie and courts her with song and ukulele.<br /><br />This is lightweight stuff to be sure, but Allen offers a fine script and compelling characters to make it enjoyable.  Some of the best scenes are with Stanley and his Aunt Vanessa (Eileen Atkins) who lives near the Catledge\\'s.  In one particular scene, Stanley argues with himself as to whether he should pursue Sophie.  Vanessa provides one liners that bounce back Stanley\\'s own arguments.  It\\'s funny and sweet.  Granted, we know all is not what it seems but I won\\'t spoil the Agatha Christie-like reveal.  To be sure, this isn\\'t one of Allen\\'s masterpieces or even one of his best.  But I enjoyed it and recommend it, especially to Allen\\'s fans.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer comes in a 1080p video resolution with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The technicians do a serviceable job transferring the film to the digital format.  The filmmakers chose a light hazy, sepia tone to the picture and it is nicely replicated here.  Close-ups are particularly good with fine detail and excellent skin tones consistent with the overall limitations.  Black levels are generally good.  Light grain can be seen throughout.  I was a little surprised to see a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track with this movie.  I seem to remember Allen almost always goes with stereo.  In any case the audio is very good, although the surrounds are mostly in play with the musical score and an early scene when Sophie and Stanley get caught in a thunderstorm.  The dialog centric movie is very clear with most of the audio coming from the center speaker.  The package includes subtitles in English SDH, Spanish and French.  Extras include a piece called \"Behind the Magic\" and another \"On the Red Carpet\" as well as a trailer.',\n",

My last video camera was from years ago (so long that it used tape!), so this was my first experience with a digital video camera. I don't think I have to say I came away impressed.<br /><br />First of all, I wasn't looking forward to having to buy a bunch of storage for a digital video camera. Storage is expensive, plus keeping track of cards is just annoying. Well, imagine my surprise when I discovered that this video camera has almost 100 GB of internal storage! That's enough for almost 40 hours of recording, which is more than I'd use it before pulling the data off.<br /><br />When you take it out of the box, the way the camera is built is a little disconcerting. This camera has pretty incredible image stabilization, which prevents your video from reflecting the natural shakiness of your arm. But to do that, the internal bits of the camera float around inside. Basically, when you take it out and hear things thumping around in the camera you're probably going to think it's broken. But no, that's how it's supposed to be, and you'll get used to it.<br /><br />My favorite feature of the camera is its built-in projector. No longer do you have to wait to unload video from the memory card before watching! The projector is such a great feature, and it works very well. Image quality is sharp and it's pretty intuitive to use.<br /><br />Overall, I'm impressed with this camera. It is on the expensive side, but you're getting a lot for your money here, as this thing is feature-packed.\",\n",

       " (\"The G1077M is part of the Gitzo Classic Center Ball Head series, marketed as a petite head for travelers and matched to their carbon fiber Mountaineer tripods. I bought it in 2004 to use on a Gitzo G1028 Mountaineer. My gripped EOS 10D and 17-40 4L USM zoom were too close to the 4.4 LB load limit and I was fighting drifting in portrait orientation. So rather than struggle with every angle, I bought the next size up, the Gitzo G1177M, rated to 8.8 LB. All it needed was a modest amount of torque and the angle was locked. The G1177M became my favorite head and traveled with me for a decade.<br /><br />The wee G1077M languished for years in a desk drawer, unused and forgotten. I started shooting with an Olympus E-P3 micro 4/3 system and needed a small tripod to complement it. So I installed the G1077M on my Manfrotto 209B table top tripod and the combo was magic: balanced, light and smooth as silk. And no drift whatsoever. The E-P3 felt like it belonged on that head. Although the E-P3 is metal and armed with an EVF and fast prime, it's still a lightweight compared to even a petite DSLR.<br /><br />So while the G1077M is not well suited for heavy DSLRs, it is ideal for compact cameras like M4/3 or point 'n shoot, and at its best mounted on a table top tripod like a Manfrotto 209B or Giottos QU500. In a pinch, a DSLR works fine on the G1077M as long as you stick to horizontal orientation.<br /><br />CONSTRUCTION: Most metal parts are magnesium for strength and minimal weight. The ball housing sports an attractive sliver and black speckle enamel and, after years of use, has proved to be surprisingly chip and scratch resistant. The bottom is tapped for a standard 3/8 inch tripod mount thread. The top platform has a 1/4 inch bolt for mounting a camera.<br /><br />A single large knob is used for locking the ball. There is no separate tension knob. To mount a camera you loosen it and turn the top platform until the screw is snug. The platform is large and knurled for a sure grip even in wet weather.<br /><br />One odd thing I noticed while everything was apart was the ball is hollow and I could look down the stem and see out the bottom. Probably the hollow ball is a weight saving measure.<br /><br />KIRK QR Clamp Install: I have Arca-Swiss quick release plates on all my cameras so I decided to add a small Kirk QR clamp to the G1077M [[ASIN:B006U43AMA Kirk Enterprises 1'' Quick Release Clamp]]. First I screwed it into the 1/4 bolt on top of the disk. I soon realized the disk was redundant and removed it, mounting the Kirk clamp directly on the ball stem. The appearance is OEM and the operation is smooth, fast and natural. The installation of the Kirk clamp on the stem was harder than expected due to Locktite on the threads. I had to hold the stem still with a small pliers (with cloth to keep from scratching it) and unscrew the disk with rubber gloves for extra grip. The 1/4 inch stud had Locktite too and I had to use the pliers to remove it too. I cleaned off the Locktite and repositioned the stud so the top was flush with the top of the Kirk clamp (& deeper in the stem). And, yes, I applied a wee bit of Locktite 242 to keep the rig from turning under load. So 30 minutes of toil but what a great lightweight combo!<br /><br />LOAD CAPACITY: This is only a 120 g head and rated for light duty loads of 4.4 pounds, albeit the true capacity is much lower. I've owned heads from Manfrotto, Gitzo, Sunwayfoto and Really Right Stuff and they all greatly exaggerate load capacity. The Manfrotto and Gitzo heads tend to lock securely at about 50% of their rated load capacity. Indeed, I found about 2 LBs to be the true capacity while using the drop slot or at a steep angle. I recently tested a [[ASIN:B00AMNWXDW SUNWAYFOTO FB-28 Mini Tripod Ball Head Arca Compatible 7 oz Sunway FB28]], rated at 26 LB, and found the true capacity to be about 2 LB as well.<br /><br />LAST BLURB: The weight and space conscious traveler desiring a high quality head for point'n shoot and M4/3 cameras can't go wrong with the G1077M. And it is even better with the Kirk QRC-1 mounted topside, making for fast and secure connections. The Gitzo-Kirk pairing appears OEM and the combined operation is smooth, fast and natural.<br /><br />Finally, many will question why would anybody in their right mind spend upwards of $160 for a table top tripod. I certainly wouldn't if I didn't already own a G1077M. Nevertheless, this rig is light, fits in my jean pocket and provides amazingly solid support for my Olympus E-P3 camera.\",\n",

       " (\"This product is very attractive looking and I love the way it looks on my bedside table. I use this primarily for the time, date, temperature display and for that it works great. The instructions are very easy to follow. I have tested out all the features and some work great while others are a mixed bag. -Time/date. Very straight forward and the orange glow through the wood is great. The snooze button dims the display which is normally the setting I have it on. Note: the dot in the upper left corner of the time display means pm. -Temperature. I find this to be pretty accurate but it does depend where the back of the block is facing, for example if it's facing a window it will likely not be an accurate reading of the room temperature. The directions say it can be up to two degrees off. -Alarms. These work consistently fine and are fairly easy to set. -Speaker. The bluetooth is automatically on when plugged in and will show up when searching for devices on your portable device. To shut the bluetooth off you hold the call/pause button down for 3 seconds. Sound quality wasn't the best I've ever heard but it was decently loud and much better than expected. If you are looking primarily for a bluetooth speaker I would look elsewhere though. There is also an aux in for devices that don't have bluetooth. -Wireless charger. Even without a case on this won't charge my phone and appears to be faulty. Do not buy for the wireless charging aspect. For me this isn't a deal breaker as there is a usb plug in for charging and I have found most of these wireless chargers to be slow and unreliable. -Usb plug in. You can plug in your charging cable to this and it charges fine and eliminates the need to plug in a wall charger. This makes up for the wireless charger in my opinion.  Build quality seems good and sturdy and the product has a good weight. One thing to note is that the product is a bit larger and wider than I expected and does take up my whole night table. The product measure about 9&#34;x 5.5&#34;x 2.5&#34;. Overall super unique and I recommend it even if all the features aren't up to par. HOWEVER I want to make it clear that if you are purchasing this it would be for looks (which I personally think looks awesome) not so much for features. The clock/date/temperature display works great and that is primarily what I got it to use for. There is no radio and this product is not advertised to have a radio.\",\n",

Yes a lot of the none important characters have psp graphics with HD gloss but tbh it doesn't matter they have so little screen time.  This is a war story with politics, backstabbing, and requires the player to have some intelligence with regards to how wars were fought. i.e WW1 and WW2. No I'm not saying go read them and you'll understand Type 0 but a lot of what people are saying is confusing just makes me laugh at their stupidity.  The Story Is brilliant: Let me just say this. If you don't get the story (As I've found it very very easy to follow) your stupid. Drop the game and go play hello kitty.  The amount of content in here, and the fact that it was originally a PSP title, it blows my mind. Awesome storyline, fun combat, and a great cast of characters. It's a must buy for any FF fan and anyone who wants to try out a fun action JRPG. True fan with the cash, can pick up one of the bundles like this one: http://fave.co/1bKMyKr  Trust me if you are a FF fan or Fan of FFX and FFVII your going to completely love this game.  What I can't understand is characters I find so funny like nine are being called annoying. Guys stop trying to find the reason of life in FF go outside get a life and stop taking it so seriously.  As for the critics reviews they are dead wrong and they will live to regret it. Look at destiny they did they stupid &#34;We've taken a few classes in good story writing and read some books there fore we know what we're talking about&#34; **** Gave the game a terrible score and it won a bafta.  How many hours have I played 22 hours yes. And what's amazing is that all 14 characters feel OP they all so good. I can hardly (acutally I can't) find a bad team make up. The character design is just amazing.  The reviewing industry is in shambles and the fact that this game is 74 on metacritc just proves it. It should have universial acclaim.  Look SE well done with this game it's amazing and thank you for giving me another real FF game  In the end if you're not at least checking this game out, your'e missing out! http://fave.co/1bKMGcQ\",\n",

This is stating the obvious, of course, but they contain peanut and tree nut (almond oil) ingredients.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, one serving is an ounce, which contains 120 calories (35 from fat). One serving has 0.5 grams of saturated fat but no cholesterol. One serving has 35 mg of sodium and 20 g of carbohydrates (very little fiber and about 10g of sugar). Finally, these have 3g of protein per serving and a tiny amount (about 2%) of iron. If I haven't mentioned something else that is commonly included on the nutrition part of the label, that's because it isn't in this product (i.e., no vitamin C).<br /><br />Texture-wise, these are very similar to the hard/crunchy kind of granola bars. These are broken into pieces maybe 1/2 inch square (not quite 1/2 inch thick). You do see big, whole peanut halves in these. I mostly notice the peanut flavor; the quinoa doesn't add much flavor and the ginger is more of a mild undertone (it's there, but not overpowering).<br /><br />Maybe it's because I haven't let myself eat too many snack foods lately or maybe not, but I think these things are delicious. I'd definitely consider buying these in the future (as well as looking for other flavors from the same company).\",\n",

I just went out and picked up the bar with the highest cocoa content assuming I'd be getting a the highest dose of flavanols (the class of flavanoid that is found in cocoa)... after a little more research though, I realized I'd picked the wrong brand for that. Looking at the ingredients, you'll see that the cocoa is &#34;processed with alkali&#34; (aka Dutch processed chocolate). Apparently, 60-90% of flavanoids are removed during Dutch processing (according to wikipedia). From what I read, you're much better off trying trying to find &#34;natural&#34; chocolate if you are going for the health benefits.  On the other hand... I'm totally addicted to this chocolate! At first I found it too bitter and ate it along with some grapes to help sweeten it up, but after a few nights my palate has changed and am loving it just the way it is. Too bad about the Dutch processing.  If you are going for the healthiest brand regardless of price, it looks like the Xocai brand is the way to go. Not only is it natural, but it's cold pressed (heating the chocolate also removes flavinoids) and is sweetened with açai berries. I couldn't find any data on how big of a difference in flavanoid content of cold pressed and non-cold pressed chocolate, but I doubt it's worth the current cost.  There's a few good dark chocolates available here at amazon that are natural and dairy free with high cocoa content including: Dragoba makes an 87% cocoa organic chocolate bar, and Endangered Species makes one at 88% (Black Panther Extreme Dark Chocolate). Stay away from bars that don't post their ingredients on Amazon (such as Green & Black's organic 85% cocoa dark chocolate bar which contains whole milk).

I have four dogs, two of them are as old as dirt. OK, actually they are 16 (Milton) and 18 (Max). Milton has no teeth and Max has no front teeth. The Vet said dogs use teeth to bite and tear, not to grind food to mush (like we do) and that even without teeth they may like to each crunchy food. She was right... they actually prefer it because it's easier for them to pick up. They are Doxies and they have long noses, but short jaws. This is a problem because the wet food sticks to their bowls and they can't get it into their mouths, and it's like watching a dog try to eat peanut butter. (OK, I know that can be totally funny and I'll admit to laughing at my lab after giving her peanut butter. But it's only funny when it's a treat, not when they are really hungry.) OK, all that to tell you this kibble is perfectly small. We used to buy regular food and smash it with a meat tenderizer, (yep, that's a hassle) but this is small enough as is. They also have sensitive tummies, but this stuff never makes them barf. And, they both continue to get excellent blood test results, so I think this food does provide good nutrition for them. They have been eating Nutro for years, and they are hella old... so that in itself is a good reason to buy this food.\",\n",

       " (\"This is a pretty good value for the money (at $28) but does have a couple minor issues which reading this review will hopefully make less of a problem...  On the positive side, the camera sensitivity is quite good and provides a very viewable image in most every lighting condition - even those really tough high-contrast daytime situations with lots of bright and shady areas. The IR LEDs provide surprisingly good lighting range out to at least 20 feet and beyond in nice dark conditions. The IR mode is the &#34;IR Cut&#34; type which switches between color and B&W IR modes at a preset low-light threshold. This provides proper daytime color compared to the weird daytime colors of non-switching cameras which simply &#34;mix&#34; IR and visible light. The 3.6mm lens provides a wide recto-linear (non-fisheye) field of view which covers a lot of area. The image quality seems nice and crisp in daylight but a little grainy/fuzzy in really low light as one would expect. The all metal housing is quite tough and can be mounted with the all wiring and screws secluded to help prevent tampering/vandalism.<br /><br />On the downside, this camera does NOT come with a 12v power supply, but the good news is that it has BNC video and RCA type power connectors which are pretty-much the standard nowadays.  The camera itself is in a metal &#34;ball&#34;, which  is compression-mounted in the housing, and is VERY hard to move when the housing is tightened-down. The housing is composed of three metal parts which are threaded together at the base. The manual does not cover mounting or aiming the camera at all and so one just has to figure this out or read it in a review such as this.<br /><br />The base can be dis-assembled by twisting the mounting base and threaded ring in opposite directions until it threads apart. The housing must be completely dis-assembled in order to mount the camera using the 4 screw holes in the base ring. Once you have it apart it will make sense. After the base is mounted, the wiring can be threaded through the mounting surface, and the camera and housing can be re-assembled. You can aim the camera just before tightening the housing the rest of the way.<br /><br />Some notes about the IR mode... The camera's internal relay makes an audible &#34;click&#34; when switching between day/IR modes, and in some cases it will switch back and forth several times when it's right on the threshold. This is especially true when artificial lights are also present in the camera's view. A short jitter in the video is normal when the camera switches modes. Also, avoid placing the camera where any objects or surfaces are near the front of the camera, as the IR LED light tends to reflect back onto the lens, producing a light gray, ring-shaped fog over your night image which greatly reduces the night vision quality. If you must mount the camera in tight spaces with eves or other structures near the front of the camera, you can use flat black spray paint on those surfaces to reduce the IR backscatter and improve your night image quality.  Hope this helps!\",\n",

My husband has worked on all of our cars for years. He is also a mechanical engineer. When we read all the reviews about it being a tight fit, we thought those people were being dodo birds.<br /><br />We put our 2009 Acura MDX up on car ramps and my husband struggled for two hours on a Friday night before giving up. There is too much build up to install this hitch without thoroughly cleaning all the gunk off and using the tap in the bolt holes under the vehicle. We thought we would get a tap on Saturday and get it installed. \"How hard would it be to find a 14 mm tap? We live in the Seattle are so it shouldn\\'t be a problem,\" we thought. Oh. How. Wrong. We. Were. Places like Ace Hardware and Shucks Auto do not carry a tap that large in-store. They were special orders only. After calling a few friends out of desperation, we were referred to Tacoma Screw in Seattle and they had one. Machine shops are not open in the weekends, so that\\'s why we had trouble getting one. It took five hours to track one down.<br /><br />Once my husband used the tap on all the holes, the hitch went right on. It was still a snug fit, but he didn\\'t have to struggle.<br /><br />We have been using the hitch for about a month now. It looks good on the car and didn\\'t require a special bumper trim piece. We are happy with the hitch itself and have used it to attach our Yakima Holdup bike rack.<br /><br />I also recommend buying the hitch cap if ordering the hitch from Amazon. It was under four bucks and gives the hitch a more polished look when not in use.<br /><br />The hitch arrived from Amazon on a Friday instead of Monday as Amazon estimated a three days sooner than expected. It was packaged in the original Curt box. It was supported nicely in the cardboard box and the hitch was wrapped to prevent scratches. The hitch was in pristine condition.<br /><br />This hitch would have gotten 5 stars, but I feel like there should be a recommendation from the manufacturer to have the tap on hand when you start, thus only 4 stars.',\n",

Went to Wal-Mart.  I stood back.  I stared.  I reviewed specs and stats.  I vacillated between going \"cheap\" (a.k.a. \"no name\" or \"somewhat familiar\" name) and famous \"name brand\".  I run a moderately-sized independent inn  (hotel) with 20 rooms and needed to make a wise purchase.  I have a 65\" LG 3D TV at home purchased last Christmas through Amazon.  Love it...but after the \"dust settled\" in this 32-inch category.....I looked at prices and caught a sale at WallyWorld ($268)....with Best Buy matching it....I bought 20 of these babies.  Samsung....not LG.  WHY?..you ask?<br /><br />First....there is NO such thing as a non-\"flimsy\" TV base.  After taking the very first one out of the box...I saw part of the \"shaky problem\".  The metal frame and the shiny black plastic overlay do not fit perfectly together with every TV.  NO BIGGIE.  I estimated the engineering issue at about 1/32\"-1/64\" of \"play...front to back.  Solution? I got a cheap roll of RUBBER electrical tape (not vinyl), cut ONE 1-inch piece and tacked it on top of the base-bottom rubber pad (rear one).  VOILA.  No...more....wobble....or shake.  Sure....this COULD have been prevented with better production of the metal base and plastic molding....but what is....is.  C\\'mon people!  No need to bellyache....look for solutions!  It now has NO wobble.  Yeah...make sure that you \"crank\" in the 7 screws so they bottom out....and a slight extra crank.  You\\'re done.  Attach your coax.....attach the power cord.....turn it on.....click...click....click.....wait for the channels to memorize (if you have cable, etc.) then wait the 10-15 minutes of plug-in-play programming to finish up.  Program the date and time.  Enjoy your TV.  Samsung has a great rating for a reason.  Clean.  Bright.  Crisp.<br /><br />Oh...the LG was my second choice....but I preferred the brightness/vibrancy of this Samsung.  Plus the \"swoopy\" design of the lower part of the TV frame in front seemed more \"modern\". I DO wish that there was a volume limiter option...but, alas....this is a consumer-grade TV...not an overpriced \"hotel grade\". SUPERB VALUE at this price point.  Oh....don\\'t sweat the 60Hz vs. 120 or the 720p vs. 1080p.  At 32 inches.....your eyes/brain will HARDLY know the difference.  Sorta like the difference between 87 and 92 octane.  You\\'ll hardly notice.  Except for the $50-$100 dollar difference.  I noticed THAT! BTW, there is NO \"tilt\" on this base.  I have NO idea where THAT previous comment came from....<br /><br />I may write more as time goes by.  For now....I have 12 more TVs to install.  Anyone want twenty-three 27-inch, 60lb CRT (tube) prehistoric TVs?  Goodwill, here I come....<br /><br />UPDATE 11/9/12:  I am still VERY please with this TV.  I have the open-box-to-all-set-up process down to 5 minutes (plus the self-programming which takes about 15 minutes).  Indeed, there is a consistent, very SLIGHT off-level issue with the stand base.  One 1-inch slice of rubber electrical tape on the REAR bottom pad is all it takes.  There are NO issues with ill-fitting screws AT ALL.  Just eat your spinach beforehand so you can put a bit of \"umph\" in your final twists - they are self-tapping. This is really a great bang-for-the-buck at $268 (WM).',\n",

       " (\"Halo Reach is up there with Modern Warfare 2 and Battlefield 3 as the best shooter of the xbox 360 generation.<br /><br />This is simply an incredible game. The graphics are grittier. The gameplay is tighter. Gone is the too-obvious auto-aim in Halo 3. The Flood does not exist at all. The Elites are not superfriends, but are a vicious enemy.<br /><br />There is more the reality that the SPARTAN soldiers are really distrusted by many humans.<br /><br />Where Halo 3 felt like an xbox 1 game with some next-gen graphic features tacked on, Halo Reach truly feels next-gen. The lighting is better, everything is crisper, it is simply a superior game.<br /><br />What makes this game great for me is that it is sci-fi, and yet it feels so real. The SPARTAN soldiers are otherworldly, yet some of the early game locales feel like isolated farming hamlets not too different from Earth. Early on, I got the sense that the SPARTAN team was reminiscent of Latin American death squads, which at least is somewhat more realistic of groups of men with guns who maraud across the countryside. If you know anything about the game's fiction, if not for the Covenant invasion, that is pretty much what the SPARTAN soldiers would have been: fascist stormtroopers taking out high-value targets of the human opposition, because the lumbering government refused to negotiate.<br /><br />But then the Covenant arrive and that gives them the opportunity to unite against a common enemy and be heroes.<br /><br />Because this is, after all, a video game.<br /><br />Still, I appreciated that early part.

       " (\"There have been many attempts to create educational &#34;games&#34; over the years. During the early days of home computing, most kids saw right through this (though I admit to quite enjoying Where in the World is Carmen San Diego before realizing it was teaching me stuff). Beyond those early days, I have very little exposure to learning games, but like many parents, I feel better with my child running &#34;educational&#34; software rather than midless space shooters. With that in mind, here are my impressions of this LeapFrog title...<br /><br />Last year, I got my then-3 year old son a LeapPad 2, and earlier this year I got to upgrade him to a LeapPad 3 so we could review it for Amazon. Since then, he has accumulated a small variety of cartridges for it, and he spends time on his &#34;green iPad.&#34; He still prefers to watch YouTube toy review videos on his mom's real iPad, though.<br /><br />For his 4th birthday, he received a new Thomas the Tank Engine playset and this Rainforest cartridge. He was thrilled at the new Thomas set, but I managed to get him to spend a bit of time with the LeapPad. The game spends some time with cute animations an narrations explaining what it is about. He was not in the mindset to focus on all the talking and was trying to skip through them. Once the actual game began, it appeared to be a platform-style game. My son has not become video game obsessed yet (he still prefers real world play), so I helped him a bit with basic controls. The character walked through the rainforest until it touches an animal. Then, icons come up and dialog plays describing attributes of different types of animals. It then asks the player to choose what type of animal they just found. It followed up with a similar thing about types of feed (webbed, bird claws, etc.) and asks about that. At least in the first stage, it appeared to be a simple &#34;I'll tell you something, then ask you a question&#34; quiz program, disguised as a platform game.<br /><br />Ithought it was neat (though as a child, I would have found it a very un-fun video game, but certainly a more entertaining educational title). My son, however, soon went back to moving toy trains around his new multi-level playset. I expect he will revisit this title in coming months/years (it has a good age range), but it is clear that right now, video games won't pull him away from the Island of Sodor.<br /><br />I don't find anything particular bad about this title, and it seems an entertaining way to learn about animals and such. I suppose if you child is more in to rainforest stuff than trains, they would find this far more interesting.\",\n",

When she performs on stage, she smiles and friendly engages with the crowd. She mostly rambles about in this video on how she got started with dancing, the MMC, her hometown, and working on her first album and music videos. I do admit that hearing songs like Sometimes and From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart does take me back to middle school and how nice and innocent those days were. I actually like those songs better than Baby One More Time. As mushy and corny those songs can be, I did enjoyed the sweet sentiment of those songs. I think after she broke up with Justin, you could definitely see the changes in her personality and behavior. She started doing really stupid things, but I guess she kinda wise up from her mistakes now that she's older.

       " ('Sea Power of the State, written by Admiral of the Fleet Sergei G. Gorshkov and published in 1976 during his tenure as the Soviet Navy\\'s Commander-in-Chief, provides a rarely available view into the strategic thinking which guided the development and disposition of Russian Naval forces during the 1960\\'s and 1970\\'s; the first time Russia possessed naval forces capable of conducting sustained operations on the world\\'s oceans--albeit a fleet relying primarily on submarines. A considerable achievement given that when Gorshkov assumed command of the Russian Navy in 1956 it consisted primarily of vessels designed for coastal defense and was incapable of logistically supporting the ocean operation of its few capital ships or its large submarine force.  A former Naval Officer who was assigned during the aforementioned period to ships participating in an ASW (Anti-Submarine Warfare) Group which on occasion practiced the art of ASW by chasing Soviet submarines across the Pacific Ocean, as well as having personally participated as an Officer of the Deck (OOD) in sea going Soviet Navy precipitated surface confrontations, I found Gorshkov\\'s writings interesting and most informative. \"Sea Power of the State,\" however, is not an easy read, perhaps due to translation difficulties when proceeding from Russian into English or due to the style in which Gorshkov communicated his thoughts. Further, individual points are to frequently repeated, almost to the point of nuisance. And, of course, the book is replete with \"socialist\" anti-western verbiage about the evil motivations of the aggressive imperialist nations--especially the United States. Given the Soviet Union\\'s de facto record of Eastern Europe colonization, a reader can only wonder whether Gorskov\\'s expressed political views actually reflect the thinking of the Soviet High Command or were just pro forma boilerplate.  \"Sea Power of the State\" is divided into several parts and opens with a 25+ page dissertation on the economic significance of ocean floor minerals, etc. giving the impression this geological survey will play a key factor underlying Gorshkov\\'s strategic views, however, the subject area essentially (not totally) disappears from the book thereafter. It is followed by a similarly treated 30 page discussion of the importance of fishing and merchant shipping to the sea power of a state.  The next two chapters contain a 100+ page view of \"The History of [Selected] Navies\" and a 50+ page treatise on the author\\'s views of the \"The Development of Navies after the Second World War.\" These reviews and their encompassed assessments seem to provide the historical analysis on which Gorshkov based the strategic goals and objecitves he envisioned the Soviet Navy pursuing and the force formations he would configure to affect those goals.  When reviewing the American and British oceanic conflict with opposing German and Japanese fleets, Gorshkov\\'s concentration repeatedly focuses how (he viewed) submarine warfare\\'s influence on the war\\'s outcome, leading him to conclude:  \"Submarines become the most important means of battle at sea. And if individual states in the pre-war period underestimated their possibilities, in the course of the war they changed their views on the use of submarine forces. .... Earlier the view was repeatedly expressed that submarines are a weapon of the weakest fleet and that strong fleets have no need of them. However, this view was flatly rebutted by the experience of the war [when] submarines of the strongest American fleet performed [the] most important role ... not only ... against Japanese shipping, but also against surface ships and submarines.\"  Gorshkov, however, fails to correctly comprehend the strategically decisive role played by Aircraft Carriers and their Air Groups during World War II in the Pacific. He absurdly attributes the Japanese post-Battle of Midway retreat onto the defensive as having occurred due to the Soviet Army\\'s victory at Stalingrad. To Gorshkov the Aircraft Carrier centric surface battles of the Pacific War could have no strategic effect because the force levels involved were so much less then were engaged in the manpower intensive (slaughters) on the Soviet / German Eastern front, perhaps demonstrating a flaw in the strategic thinking of Russian Admirals resulting from their nation\\'s geographically necessitated concentration on large scale ground warfare. Other historical events such as the participation of Russian sailors in their country\\'s 20th Century Civil War and the Soviet Navy\\'s (exaggerated) contributions to the outcome of World War II are discussed in these page, but this commentary adds little to the understanding of the strategic goals Gorshkov envisioned the Soviet Navy pursuing in the post-World War II environment.  Building on this historical analysis Gorshkov concludes that \"problems associated with the art of naval warfare\" render dominance of the sea an unobtainable strategic result--as versus its possible achievement on land surfaces. His analysis underlying this conclusion is to lengthy to repeat here, but it rests on several observations and assumptions. First, Gorshkov believes that the fluid non-fixed nature of the sea precludes a naval force from firmly establishing itself in a fixed location enforcing that dominance and, second, that modern weapons systems enable fleets to extend the distance over which they could apply their [explosive] force thereby contesting any attempt at fixed dominance of a given sea area.   Clearly Russian strategic thinking did not encompass the need to establish forward bases such as those the U.S. Navy maintains around the world, probably due to the Russian military\\'s demonstrated inability to manage substantial logistics flow over a long distance, precluding their establishing and maintaining distant bases. I personally know a number of intelligent former Russian soldiers who served in Afghanistan and asked them why the combat force the Soviet Army sent into that country was so numerically low. Their response was that their military simply lacked the logistic capabilities to sustain a force greater than 120,000 men that far from home. An acknowledgement that their nation simply lacked the management skills to logistically support a large force such as a Naval Task Group far from home, which Gorshkov must have realized.  However, despite their logistics management shortcomings, the Soviet Union did possess sufficient bright individuals with technical engineering skills and the industrial structure needed to design, produce, and staff a large number of nuclear powered submarines carrying modern weapons systems, communications capabilities, etc. needed for their Navy to maintain a large number of these vessels at sea. A technical and industrial base which Admiral Gorshkov notes necessarily underlies the development of modern navies and without which a nation cannot successfully aspire to be a sea power. Gorshkov\\'s answer, therefore, to his problems was the deployment of a large number of nuclear powered submarines which could steam almost indefinitely at sea, restricted only by their crews need for food. A force that could target the sea communications the \"imperialist\" western industrial nations needed to support their worldwide \"aggressive\" interventions, at least in the socialist speak of the Soviet high command.  \"Sea Power of the State\" is a fascinating look into the mind of the high command of one of this nation\\'s major military opponents. It is a rare treat and makes for a fascinating read, at least for officers of the opposing services and for anyone interested in how high level military officers view problems--especially a military officer as prominent and influential as was Admiral Gorshkov.',\n",

Not to mention those awfully shoddy fixtures that haven\\'t changed at least since I was a kid some 40 years ago. Having looked into alternative lighting in the past, the setups were either too expensive, ran too hot or were difficult to install.<br /><br />One thing is certain Marineland has a hit on their hands.<br /><br />The unit is simplicity itself. A sleek and smart design it\\'s as functional as it is beautiful. Solid build quality, no need for special wiring - and installation is a breeze. Simply place it on to your glass canopy, turn it on and get ready to have your jaw drop. The light from this unit is nothing short of gorgeous, it pours out crystal, pristine and brilliant. The \"shimmering effect\" is subtle and really quite remarkable - the Lunar mode is almost surreal it\\'s so beautiful.<br /><br />If you have a concern that by ordering a smaller size like the 36\" you\\'ll end up with shadows to the right and left - you\\'re correct. I called Marineland directly and they confirmed this. The person I spoke with also stressed the importance of using a Versa top to protect the fixture, fish<br />and yourself.<br /><br />I\\'ve read on the forums that some folks are using the lights without one and I would say, all it takes is one good splash and you\\'ll short the system out - not to mention void your warrantee.The unit itself is so incredibly thin, you\\'ll have no trouble fitting a canopy on top of your tank. The lights rest about 1/4 inch above the glass tops - and you\\'ll of course want to place them in the back.The end brackets are fully adjustable and make for a perfect, snap in fit.<br /><br />There\\'s a lot of bang for your buck here :<br /><br />* The day light LED lights consume only 35 watts as opposed to 80 for a single fluorescent bulb.<br /><br />* The Lunar LED lights are spectacular - and allow you to watch your fish without disturbing their natural sleep/rest cycle.<br /><br />*Each LED is covered with a Polycarbonate lens - this not only protects the bulb, but helps to create the \"shimmer effect\" hobbyists are raving about.<br /><br />* Everything you need is controlled by a single side switch. Daylight, Lunar and on and off.<br /><br />Nothing I\\'ve seen re-creates the look of actual sunlight as perfectly as this - it\\'s that spectacular.Some folks have an issue about there not being a timer, my response to this is really? it\\'s too much trouble to switch it on and off once or twice a day? Believe me it\\'s a non issue.What really matters is that you\\'ll get an impressive 17,000 lifetime hours, Daylight mode, Lunar mode, an incredible Shimmer effect that\\'s bound to just knock you out - and a whopping 1800 Lumens of clear, clean light.<br /><br />Some users have reported a slow down of brown and green algae growth - Marineland makes no such claim, but I\\'m hoping it\\'s true.Any serious fish keeper knows how often we\\'re disappointed by products that are supposed to enhance the hobby but instead add more grudge work.The Marineland Double Bright LED is one of those rare exceptions. Once you turn it on you\\'ll know immediately that the system is worth every penny. Just a brilliant product - that does more than meet your expectations, it exceeds them.',\n",

I've come to find that no matter how you wash your mat, this step is very important. The sun further removes the resin that's been applied before shipping. Bottom line? This mat is thicker, longer, more durable, and made with better material than most other mats you'll find for this price.

I also wanted one that wouldn't dry out quickly, so the fact that these are retractable means there's no cap to accidentally leave off or lose.  A couple times my coworker used one at my desk and left it with the point out. It was dry for a bit, but I just retracted it and let is sit for a few hours - work fine now!<br /><br />I originally bought a 3-pack at Staples to see if I liked them, but they were pretty expensive, about $8 or $9 for 3 pens.  When I wanted to order more, I came looking for a better deal.  This is the best price around, even adding the shipping charge.  The problem is that I haven't received the pens!  It's been 10 days and not only do I not have them, Amazon sent me email stating they can't get any shipment info from the seller.  I haven't been charged yet, but I'd really rather have the pens!<br /><br />UPDATE: I did receive the pens, at about the 12-day mark.  A few of them seemed dry right out of the box.  I revived one or two of them by dampening the tip slightly and using it until the ink started working again, but one had to be thrown away.  I still like these pens, but I'm also keeping an eye out for a more affordable alternative.  They're now up to about $35/dozen!\",\n",

Also, your choice of time for each frame is 3 sec. 5 sec. then 15 seconds. 7 to 10 would be perfect. You can turn off the motion sensor so it keeps playing if no one is around, which is what we need. I put various sized pictures on it and they all filled the screen correctly without shrinking or stretching so that part will work great for what we're doing. The pictures display great, very representative of what they looked like coming off the camera which is what we need for judging. I'm trying video on it next week.

THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA explores a corner of the cutthroat fashion industry, a nerve-wracking environment replete with competitive jealousies and general, all-around meanspiritedness. Into this world steps Anne Hathaway\\'s character, Andrea \"Andy\" Sachs, an aspiring journalist eager to get a foot in the door. To gain invaluable experience, Andy interviews for a job as the assistant\\'s assistant to the ridiculously demanding Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), acclaimed head of the trend-setting Runway magazine.<br /><br />Andy is a size six, and this automatically makes her the brunt of mean jokes by those in her new work office. Andy comes from a down-to-earth place and sort of scoffs at her co-workers\\' unending obsession with haute couture. She promises her boyfriend cook Nate (Adrian Grenier) that she won\\'t change. But of course she does. Andy loses her way.<br /><br />Meryl Streep submits yet another powerhouse performance as the film\\'s dragon lady. Miranda Priestly is the sort of boss who can effortlessly, whimsically shatter an employee\\'s self-esteem. I take in the twitchy reactions of those in her circle and how they tiptoe on eggshells whenever she\\'s in the room, and even I start to sweat. But Meryl Streep is able to sneak in an echo of vulnerability. You may end up sympathizing with her a bit. This actress is just so consistently good.<br /><br />Stanley Tucci himself is masterful in another of his side character roles. I think every movie should have Stanley Tucci in it. Emily Blunt as Miranda Priestly\\'s frazzled first assistant - and Andy\\'s primary foil - is fun to watch, and she makes the most out of her thankless role. When THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA first released in 2006, Anne Hathaway was only then just starting to distance herself from her wholesome teen princess roles. So she was a question mark, going into this film, even with HAVOC and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN in her rearview.No worries, she confidently steps into this post-Disney role, and she\\'s quite good.<br /><br />Because there\\'s something innately appealing about Hathaway. Even when her character does eventually sell out, you don\\'t hate her. You\\'re not mad-dogging her. You just want her to get back on track. The film easily develops a rooting interest for her. Her immediate boss, the first assistant, is so cruddy in her behavior towards Andy that Andy right away falls into that underdog slot. Except she overcomes that soon enough. Andy, who is brainy enough that she rejected Stanford Law to pursue her journalistic dreams, turns out to be endlessly resourceful in meeting Miranda Priestly\\'s incessant, impossible demands. It\\'s not too long before the first assistant is demoted. Yay for Andy. You could feel her getting more and more sucked into this seductive world. Her long-suffering boyfriend\\'s patience is wearing thin.<br /><br />This film renders me a stranger in a strange land, forced to absorb exotic name brands like Prada, Valentino Garavani, Giorgio Armani, and others I would have to look up on Wiki. I desperately longed for someone to name drop the Gap or Old Navy or Fruit of the Loom, something familiar. Gratifyingly, the story drew me in. The acting fixated me to the screen.

This board has many things going for it, several of which I will list:<br /><br />1) It is well made, and despite being MSI's budget motherboard, it compares nicely to boards in the $100+ category.<br />2) It has four memory slots for a maximum of 32GB of RAM, not bad for a low-end board at all!<br />3) It has USB 3.0 ports, something missing from many of its competitors, and even has headers for two more!<br />4) It has a SATA3 port for getting the most of an OS SSD.<br />5) It has one each of PCIEx16, PCIEx1 and PCI, meaning you won't have to upgrade an old PCI card if you don't want to.<br />6) It is compatible with OSX with little to no modification.<br /><br />I was first drawn to MSI's motherboards after reading an article about hackintosh-compatible mATX motherboards. MSI boards, it seems, are just as easy to use as Gigabyte, and in my opinion are MUCH better looking. MSI has done a great job with the color scheme, which is understated without being too muted. With several power saving options, this is a great HTPC/general home use motherboard but don't let that put you off! It supports RAM up to 2400mhz and will play nicely with even the Core i7 processors!<br /><br />Now, I really want to take a second and mention MSI's UEFI BIOS. This thing is amazing, and if you haven'te experienced UEFI BIOS's yet, you're in for a treat. The thing looks great, has intuitive controls, and heck, you can even use your mouse! The BIOS has three settings: power saving, normal and overclocked. It has automatic overclocking (apparently going off of your components automagically) or you can overclock manually. I'm not an overclocker so I can't really comment, but I saw controls for changing clock speeds and voltages for both the CPU and the RAM, as well as various other settings which I'm sure others will find much more useful than I did!<br /><br />I tried to think of some drawbacks to this motherboard, but with USB 3.0 support and four slots of DDR3, the only minor complaint I have is that there is only one SATA3 port. Still, you can have your OS drive on the one avaialble, and the only reason I would want a second is for my test rig. Barr any possible issues like I had with my Z77MA (power cycle loop) I highly recommend this as a VERY attractive 1155 mATX board. I don't think you'll regret choosing this budget board!\",\n",

The instructions aren\\'t the most straightforward, but with carfeul reading they can be figured out.  I went through a few DVDRs before I could figure out to record from VHS to DVD, but I figured it out,  The good thing about this is it has Composite, S-vide(great for recording to my Dazzle capture card with Amcap and Windows Media Encoder), Component(Both interlaced and Progressive), HDMI(both YPbPr and RGB)(great for TVs like some Sonys that have no composite or S-Video inputs, you can use this as an RF modulator)) outputs, digital 5.1 coax audio output, and an extra set of L and R audio coutputs(wish they had volume control, but don\\'t).  And for inputs, 2Composite, 2 S-Video(which is great for recording from my computer\\'s GeForce3 video card), both stereo.  4 Head VCR looks great through HDMI, as does the DVD.  Has nice manual tracking.  Not sure if it can record to S-Vhs at optimum quality.  Also, keep in mind \"upscaling\" will not make your video any higher definition than it was originally recorded.  But the upscaling is good for cheap TVs like Westinghouse that don\\'t give you many screen sizing options.  Cons:  One model of this has a tuner(ZV457MG9), the other does not(ZV427MG9(mine)).  Not a VCD or SVCD recorder, only plays VCD.  Not a multi regional DVD player, won\\'t even play all region PAL DVDs, though it does play my PAL no region DVD-Rs made from my computer.  DVD recorder does not deinterlace the video recorded to the DVD, which might leave heavy lines on the image, especially with up and down motion image quality may be reduced, compared to a deinterlaced image recorded(through a capture card with Amcap and WIndows Media Encoder or similr program, or screencaptured from a DVD played from a computer\\'s drive) to a computer, quality may be inferior, but the Closed Captioning signal does show when outputted through an interlaced output on the player, like composite, S-video, and Component(interlaced only, ie. not progressive scan).  Has stupid Macrovision copy protection, which prevents recording of certain things.  VCR is incapable of recording or playing PAL signals.  As with most video aplliances these days, you need to have the remote.  No volume control.  No LP/EP option for recording with VCR.  DVD plays automatically when turned on, which can be annoying if you want to use the VHS instead, so you have to wait to stop the DVD or eject it.',\n",

Pre sorting, instead of all in one, does save time.  Seems like it and the bags will take some good years of abuse.  I'm glad the bags have replacements.  Even though you can cram a lot into one bag, it isn't too heavy to haul one bag by itself.<br />One day I had to leave a wet load in a bag overnight and it didn't drip., because of some laundry problems and had to leave, instead of wait for dryer.  That said the clothes while wet didn't come out of the washer dripping, so I'm sure if I poured a cup of water in the bottom, it'd probably drip through the canvas.  Things smelled like detergent, instead of mildew, when I got to rewash the next day.<br />This definitely takes up some space and unfortunately I don't know if it will make it to intended place in my closet, soon and doesn't look so nice hanging out in my bedroom.

It is sturdy and man...does it kick out some heat. I didn't need to push it all the way for my purposes. I used about 1/2 power and had 8 gallons of hose water boiling in 24 minutes! That was with a lid on.<br /><br />When it came time to boil my wort, it worked great. I didn't time it, but it was quickly up to boiling, and I had about 7.5 gallons going. It could easily handle more, I just don't have a pot big enough to test it.<br /><br />The great part is that there is room to grow with this burner. I have a 9 gallon pot that is pretty wide, and I have the adjustable base set to the narrowest setting. I could get a 15 to 20 gallon pot on top of this burner very safely. It is rock solid and can handle a lot of weight.<br /><br />The wind baffles work well, too. It was a relatively windy day, and I was able to adjust the baffles with tilt to keep the wind from affecting the flame too much.<br /><br />I can't tell how much propane it is using up yet, as I have only one batch under my belt, but my calculations tell me that at 105,000 BTU, you will burn through a standard 20 lb. propane tank in 4 hours. As I said, I was probably going half power on the first batch, since I was getting used to the burner...so I plan on 6 to 8 hours of burn time per tank. Time will tell. This should be plenty for a couple of batches, so I am planning on spending about 10 dollars on propane per batch.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this burner...no complaints whatsoever.\",\n",

It should be a snug fit for your fingers, but this is how you test how tight it is on your animal.<br /><br />The harness itself is formed by a ring that goes around the neck like a collar (my cat has a collar and can wear both the harness and collar at the same time without overlap) and then another ring that goes around the girth of the cat (behind the shoulders and under the belly). These two rings are connected by ONE strap that goes on the dorsal (top) of the cat's body. This is exactly what I wanted when I was looking at harnesses because it makes it harder for them to get out. BOTH rings are adjustable (another plus!) and the snaps are easy to open and close.<br /><br />I've started with putting it on him and just letting him play in our apartment with it on.

       " (\"First off I want to say I love them and am very happy with the purchase. I got the 4mm in stainless set. I can even see buying the gold 4mm set as well in the future. The colors are lovely and the stones are large enough to really show the color. The packaging was small sterile piercing packs so if you are using them to actually pierce your or somebody 's ears then that might matter to you. I didn't get these for piercing, only for my own use as regular earrings.<br /><br />These have large posts and I knew that from other reviews before buying. I have ears that want to close up fairly fast so that didn't bug me. I actually wanted the larger posts to help stretch my tiny holes just a bit. However they are large posts and that might be a problem for some. For those unfamiliar gauge numbers, they get smaller as the size gets bigger. I used a caliper to measure the earrings I was pierced with and those are a 20 gauge. 18 to 20 gauge are typically used for most regular earrings. These measure out very close to a 16 gauge. Perhaps just a bit smaller like a 17 gauge? They are a bit tight for me going in and probably will be for most people who don't have their ear piercings stretched. They will fit but just be aware that it is bigger then most posts. These earring posts are just big enough to cause me a touch of discomfort and a speck of blood from getting them in. I am hoping to get my holes to this size because my ears just want to close.<br /><br />The only other thing I feel I should mention is that the posts seem to be the same actual length as most of my other earrings however...These earrings don't fit like others because of the thicker posts. It feels shorter on the ear. Now I have fairly thin earlobes and these do feel fine but because of the thicker post the post feels shorter as well. Like I said its pretty much the same length post as almost all the others I have. It just feels shorter.<br /><br />Here is my take on these.<br /><br />If you have thick earlobesthese probably won't work for you.<br />If you have tiny holes then these might feel uncomfortable going in. Even cause a touch of bleeding.<br /><br />If you have holes that are a bit stretched already then these might fit better then regular 18 or 20gauge.<br />If you have have tiny holes that want to close up fast then these might give you the right amount of stretch to your holes to open them up a bit but keep in mind you should treat your ears as re-pierced for awhile till they have a chance to get used to being this size.\",\n",

I haven't timed the run-time on it yet -- but also haven't had it run down unexpectedly.<br /><br />The headlamp band works... but battery placement is awkward when worn on the head... I put the battery pack in my shirt pocket.<br />It's mostly worn on my bike though.<br /><br />The strobe is often mentioned as useless in reviews... but it's intended to be used in daylight to make the biker more visable.<br /><br />FYI: I bought the 6 cell 6600mha battery pack for it also, but the connector isn't an exact fit. The connector works, but doesn't snap tight. A little tape would fix the problem - and to be fair, they don't really claim to be compatible.<br /><br />Also, take all of the Specs on the light and the battery with a grain of salt: If these are Cree Xm-l lamps, they are rated at a max  of<br /> 1000 lumens per bulb  (for a total potential of 3000 lumens -- not 3800) consuming 10 watts per bulb. Also, despite the claim of 6400 mAh battery pack, a typical 18650 Li-on cell is 2300-2600 mAh -- so 4 cells (2 groups of 2 in series to produce 8.4 volts) would give you closer to 4600-5200 mAh. At that rate a 30 watt load / an ave voltage of (2*3.5v) would give a current draw of 4.29 amps (4290 ma) so the supplied battery pack should last about an hour with the light on &#34;high&#34;.<br /><br />It's a great light at a great price, I docked it one star because of the bogus specs -- but don't let that deter you.\",\n",

Which has been great - I like the brand and not everyone uses them.  Or so I thought.  People I have been playing with ALSO use Callaway balls, and since mine are all different, I never know what # was on my ball, or what exact kind of Callaway it was.  I\\'d been looking for a nice way to mark my balls, without being too obnoxious.  I didn\\'t want to scrawl my initials on there, or draw a line, or a picture of a whale or what-not.  That\\'s how I decided on this gadget.  I can use it to cleanly and neatly mark my initials on a ball.<br />The contraptions works like this:  It\\'s a blue shell that fits over the golf ball. There\\'s a clear section which fits inside between the ball and the cover.  There\\'s another part of the blue cover that you screw on to the underside of the ball.  The ball fits snugly inside, and you can rotate the clear inner ring to get to the letter or number you need.  It rotates fairly cleanly: it sort of \"clicks\" with each rotation, so that it holds relatively steady when you are trying to fill in your letter or number.<br />-<br />It\\'s not the best device:<br />- It\\'s hard to screw the bottom thing on.  You really have to press and turn to get it to fit correctly, and many times, mine wasn\\'t all the way on, or the ball would move as I was trying to do this and so it would mess up where I wanted to put my initials.<br />- The inner ring is steady, but not great.  It can move around a little while trying to shade in a character.  It\\'s really not all that bad, but you do have to be careful.  I hold the device so that my hand presses down on the inner ring as well to hold it steady.<br />--<br />It does work OK:<br />- The included pen works well, and it dries quickly and doesn\\'t smudge.<br />- It\\'s stable enough so that I can get my intials on there fairly decently.<br />----<br />The blue shell also has a line on it if you need to draw a line on your ball - some people do that for alignment I guess.<br />I do recommend this device.  I am happy with the results, and it\\'s certainly priced right!!!',\n",

       " (\"I'll say it right now. Gameplay wise, Disgaea 4 is the best of the best in the series and for good reasons. The gameplay picks up after Disgaea 3 and improving it meaning weapon change is still possible and instead of giving so many characters to make and giving them too many weapons they can master, most character are limited to two to three weapons they can master. They made how many more characters bearable. You don't have to work to get a bigger classroom with mana. Instead you unlock a panel on the character map for every chapter you complete, so by the end of the game, you'll have plenty of panels. If you run out out room, the characters are placed in another room which is very beneficial for the player.<br /><br />Weapon change works much better in this game compared to the third so the monsters turn into weapons that benefits them. Seriously, who thought it would be a good idea for a magic based unit like an Alraune to be a spear in Disgaea 3. Here the Alaraune turns into a staff that makes him/her more beneficial in battle when given to a mage.<br /><br />Story wise, Disgaea 4 finally matches the first Disgaea in terms of a lovable cast and a great story. The story heavily revolves around politics, so unless you understand how politics work it will be hard to draw parallel to the real world references the game is referencing. Valvatorez is a great protagonist. Mature space cadet with a great moral standard and wonderful stats that is obsessed with sardines. His character works because he manages to be funny upon introduction. I won't spoil the story because it's easy to put together once you get into it...if you're not too busy with the item world. Which is another thing. The character world isn't available until you reincarnate one character at LV 100 (or reincarnation adds up to LV 100) meaning you won't get the character world until post game unlike Disgaea 3 which is my only negative of this game when reincarnation is essential for the post game.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great game that you should pick up if you're into games like this....<br /><br />Also Axel is back. :D\",\n",

I landed on this one purely by chance, clicked it because of the minimally intrusive design, and skipped right to Customer Reviews since manufacturers like to puff up their products (LG...).<br /><br />So I started reading the reviews, and time after time for the first 40ish, everybody had generally positive things to say. Sure, there was the incomprehensible setup/manual, but I figured &#34;I'm savvy enough I can figure it out.&#34; So I ordered it. Selected standard shipping. Expected to wait about a week and a half. Tick tock. I'm allowing myself to be excited by now.<br /><br />FOUR DAYS LATER, it's here! Oh boy oh boy oh boy! The box is long (about 4.5 feet) but somehow managed to arrive without any crushed corners or gashes. I drag it inside, set the whole package on the cocktail table in front of me and sit like a lonely, excited puppy and wait for my partner to get home. It's technically his, after all.<br /><br />He walks in, sees the long new box and his face lights up just like mine did, maybe brighter because I somehow managed to keep it a secret. Tears into it, pulls everything out of the plastic bags and puts the feet on it. Sets it in front of the TV (it's a 46&#34; and it all but lines up perfectly with it). Stares at me because he's never used a TOSLink cable... Well, neither had I so I flipped thru the book as fast as I could and 4 pages later I'm at the end with no answers. Maddeningly unhelpful! I look at the cable and match the shapes on each end, one to the bar and one to the screen. It doesn't go in! Ohhh, don't forget to pop the plastic tips off your new TOSLink connectors before you try to plug them in.<br /><br />So now we're all set up. It's connected to the TV, it's plugged in, it's ready to go. Power! Lights flashing! And...no sound. Hmm. Tap the remote on the table because that's the solve-all. Point it at the bar. Yep, it works, the lights are back. (They're white and blue, the two brightest LED colors, so they automatically turn off to mitigate glare.) I press Input on the bar's remote. Then again. And WHOA. Ear angels sing. TOSLink is Input 3, everybody. You'll need to know that, the book doesn't cover it.<br /><br />The whole setup process from unpacking to ear ecstasy took less than half an hour with no instructions and just a touch of common sense. Totally painless.<br /><br />A week later we wanted to mount it on the wall. It's literally as easy as flipping the feet and hooking it on the screws you put in the wall 3 minutes before. Again, painless.<br /><br />A few notes. It should've had Bluetooth. Turn on and then leave on &#34;SRS.&#34; It's comparable to the effect of removing earplugs with the law mower running: the sound is SO MUCH clearer, brighter. Don't bother with &#34;TVol,&#34; it seems to muffle sound more than it levels output volumes. Some of the reviews say the remote has limited range; ours works wonderfully from 15 feet away and from the sideways end of the sectional. Mount it on the wall so it's high enough to catch your remote's suggestions. And be careful when lugging it around: during our recent move it collided with a wall on one end and the stainless plate (actually plastic) jumped off and one of the prongs on the plate snapped off inside of the hole in the body. Nothing a dab of Gorilla Glue can't fix and it's really a well-built item, just don't abuse it.<br /><br />Am I happy with this? Yes. I'm on here to buy two more. I absolutely recommend it, highly. It outperforms a high-end 5.1 system. It's less than $100. GET ONE!\",\n",

So i was worried if mimogram would be the same as the other ones i've purchased. But guess what, they are not!! My mimogram cloths still look like new!

The result is easier coverage and both a better appearance and wear.  The lighter shades create a huge cloud of powder which covers you and chips much easier defeating the entire purpose of repainting.  My faves are this Navy and the Burgundy.  Also good were the OSHA Orange and the school bus Yellow.  The White looks very institutional, like nurses shoe's white, and was totally unappealing.  I used these paints to repaint a ton of old plastic garden containers.  The only ones to end up looking like something cheap from Home Depot were the white ones.  We hated them so much on our patio, we donated them to our building to be used elsewhere.<br /><br />Prep the surface!  Just b/c it says you don't have to do too much for prep, go online and learn about prepping plastic for painting.  The ones I prepped more have fared better.  Also, don't expect too much.  If you are reckless with them, they will scratch and chip.  I was careful and am happy.  However, I declined painting the plastic chairs my bldg has on the common patio, something I had planned to do.  I do not think these paints, even the darker colors could withstand the abuse a plastic stacker chair endures.  So, for something somewhat stationary, you shouldn't have issues.<br /><br />You stick to less expensive colors. The prices fluctuate wildly from $12 for a can of White to $2.50 for a can of Burgundy and are constantly changing.  Next month the White could be $3 and the Burgundy, $12.  Some of the colors go far and some = 1.5 - 2 cans to get a 20&#34; planter painted.  Suddenly your cheap dress-up for a plastic planter costs $25.  Add the labor + time and other materials like mask, gloves, drop cloths, it makes more sense to recycle your old ones and buy new.  So try to choose cheaper colors especially at first as your learning to use it for maximum coverage etc.<br /><br />So, I do recommend the product if you are willing to go the necessary distance not to be unhappy with the results.\",\n",

       " ('****No Plot Spoilers****<br /><br />  Ever since watching Brian De Palma\\'s \"Carrie\" ([[ASIN:B0047E9TRA Carrie]]) and \"The Fury\" ([[ASIN:B000G6BLO2 The Fury]]), I\\'ve been obsessed with telekinesis.  The Scanners franchise also fulfilled my desire to watch people move objects with their thoughts.  The original \"Scanners\" ([[ASIN:B00005K3NY Scanners]]) was directed by David Cronenberg who became famous for his controversial science fiction horror films starring controversial actors [e.g., \"The Brood\" ([[ASIN:B00009PY2T The Brood]]), with brawler hunk Oliver Reed, and \"Rabid\" ([[ASIN:B0001XAKUQ Rabid]]) with former porn star Marilyn Chambers].  \"Scanners\" focuses on an emotionally disturbed, homeless scanner, Cameron Vale (Stephen Lack) who meets an art gallery assistant, Kim Obrist (supermodel Jennifer O\\'Neill) who is also a scanner.  Together, they attempt to locate an evil scanner, Darryl Revok (Michael Ironside), who wants the scanners to rule the world.  During their quest, they discover the dark secret concerning the origin of scanners.  Note: Scanners not only have the ability to move objects with their thoughts, but they can also read (i.e., scan) and manipulate other people\\'s thoughts.  However, many become insane because of sensory overload.<br /><br />  Having owned \"Scanners\" on DVD for years, I was naturally thrilled to learn that Shout Factory had released its first two sequels as a Blu-Ray and DVD combo pack.  I saw them on VHS too many years ago in muted, full-frame formats.  Thanks to Shout Factory, each film has been presented correctly in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.78:1.  All colors are bright, clear and crisp and the audio is great (DTS-HD Master Audio Stereo for Blu-Ray; Dolby Digital Stereo for DVD).  Each film appears as though it has been recently released at the theatre.  There are no vertical lines or dark splotches.  I played the DVD version on my Blu-Ray player and couldn\\'t tell a significant difference from the Blu-Ray.  The remastering for both the Blu-Ray and the DVD has been excellent.  I`ll be able to loan the DVD to my girlfriend, Tammy, who doesn\\'t own a Blu-Ray player.  A horror buff like me, she\\'s going to kill me with her evil thoughts when she learns I watched these films without her.<br /><br />  Both Scanners II and III were directed by Christian Duguay.  Like \"Scanners,\" they boast gorgeous casts, contain themes of good versus evil and were filmed in and around the cold, gray environs of Montreal and Quebec, Canada.  In \"Scanners II: The New Order,\" a veterinarian student, David Kellum (David Hewitt) is a scanner on the run who finds another scanner, Julie Vale (Deborah Raffin); together they try to destroy the corrupt Commander John Forrester (Yvan Potton) who is using scanners to kill anyone who stands in his way of becoming mayor.  Similar in plot to the original \"Scanners,\" it has, however, some shocking twists.  Also, it has considerably more gore and violence than the original.  This one was more emotionally disturbing to me because it deals more with violence perpetrated against family members.<br /><br />  In \"Scanners III: The Takeover,\" a Christmas tragedy causes a scanner, Alex Monet (Steve Parrish), to become a monk in Thailand.  Meanwhile, his sister, Helena (Liliana Komorowska), also a scanner, is suffering from severe migraine.  She uses her father\\'s experimental drug and becomes insanely diabolical.  She then commandeers her father\\'s pharmaceutical company to take over the world.  As in the previous film, there is a tremendous amount of violence and gore.  Again, there is familial violence; this time, it is even sadder when relatives attempt to kill one another.  Note: I loved the unforgettable character of Helena.  She is extremely diabolical, beautiful and sensual.  Komorowska played her perfectly.<br /><br />  There are two discs in this Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack.  One disc contains both films on DVD and the other disc contains both films on Blu-Ray.  Unfortunately, the combo pack doesn\\'t have any extras.  There are no subtitles, no audio commentaries, no theatrical trailers, no deleted scenes, no \"making off featurettes,\" and, worst of all, no scene selections.  The menu gives you a choice of which Scanners movie to watch and that is all.  Unbelievable!  If not for the widescreen presentations, stereo audio and remastering, I would have thought that these two films had been released by Mill Creek, which churns out films on Blu-Ray and DVD at a high rate, regardless of quality.  Because of its blatant lack of extras, I cannot give this Scanners II and III Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack the highest rating.<br /><br />  If you are a fan of horror films, especially the ones involving telekinesis, then I recommend this Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack.  However, I wish Shout Factory had either included a digital copy or just decreased the price and given us the choice of buying the Blu-Ray or the DVD, not both.  I also wish that Shout Factory or another company would properly release \"Scanner Cop\" and \"Scanner Cop 2: Volkin\\'s Revenge\" on Blu-Ray.  Both films star Daniel Quinn as Detective Samuel Staziak who hunts down rogue scanners.  The original \"Scanners,\" released by MGM and out of print at the time of this review, also deserves the Blu-Ray treatment.  Many fans are hoping it will be re-released by the Criterion Collection.  My MGM release of \"Scanners\" only has a theatrical trailer and subtitles for extras.  A commentary from David Cronenberg would be nice.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos',\n",

       " (\"When I saw Meryl Streep play the seemingly facile Omaha housewife she portrays in this 2012 marital dramedy, I had an immediate flashback to an underrated romantic drama she did almost thirty years ago, Ulu Grosbard's [[ASIN:B0018RC7QE Falling in Love]] (1984), in which she played a young married woman who couldn't help falling for a married architect (Robert De Niro) on a commuter train. I kept thinking of Kay as that earlier character all these years later trying to fan the embers of the passion that erupted so unpredictably back then. Interestingly, her younger character could not consummate the affair either but fell hopelessly in love anyway. Director David Frankel ([[ASIN:B000MKD9P6 The Devil Wears Prada]]) and first-time screenwriter Vanessa Taylor travel to the opposite end of the marital spectrum, a 31-year-old marriage that finds Kay and her accountant husband Arnold sleeping in separate bedrooms having long ago lost any sense of intimacy and passion their marriage once had. The film begins with a seriocomic preface in which Kay awkwardly tries to seduce Arnold, an invitation he rebuffs with the flimsiest of excuses. Knowing their marriage is on auto-pilot, she fears being alone emotionally and ending their lives in emotional isolation now as they go through the motions in their sixties.<br /><br />An optimist despite the odds, Kay signs them up for a week of intensive couples therapy in Great Hope Springs, Maine, where renowned therapist Dr. Bernie Feld practices. Arnold is predictably resistant but begrudgingly accompanies her when he realizes how serious Kay is about the counseling. The sessions with Dr. Feld initially don't go well with Arnold protesting the doctor's every recommendation for building intimacy in his relationship with Kay. This is when the movie becomes the most surprising because every time a physically awkward moment presents itself, the feelings become heartfelt and sometimes humorous in unexpected ways. While Frankel and Taylor handle the slim story turns with genuine insight, it's the masterful work of Streep and Tommy Lee Jones that elevates the film into an experience that far transcends the Lifetime-TV orientation you would expect otherwise. Unafraid to come across as harshly judgmental, Jones has made a career of playing dyspeptic curmudgeons, so it's nice to see him gradually reveal Arnold's vulnerabilities with skill and delicacy. He has to play Arnold close to the vest but not so insular as to make you wonder what Kay saw in him in the first place. After tackling larger-than-life figures like Julia Child and Margaret Thatcher, Streep is splendid portraying a sheltered woman who contributes as much to the fossilized, inchoate marriage as Arnold does.<br /><br />At 63, the actress allows herself to look even beyond her age, but she's still beautiful in a shopworn way. I love how she almost swallows every word she speaks as if Kay's tentative nature is holding back grand expectations of a romance she can only fantasize about. The two veteran actors have a natural rapport that gives the viewer a rooting interest in seeing them overcome their age-old emotional and physical barriers. There are moments between them especially in the film's last third that are quite heartbreaking, especially when they come to learn that they aren't the people they believed themselves, or each other, to be. Steve Carell plays Feld straight-up without an iota of irony, and his clinical approach works effectively within this context. The rest of the supporting cast makes very little impact, including Jean Smart as Kay's sassy manager at the Coldwater Creek she works part-time, Elisabeth Shue as an equally sassy barmaid counseling Kay on sex, and Mimi Rogers as the final payoff of a joke about a comely (and yes, sassy) neighbor with a trio of corgis. The young actors who play Kay and Arnold's adult children are barely present, but I'm sure that was part of the intention in order to allow complete focus on the couple. Frankel overdoes the soundtrack music when moments of silence would have been far more effective, but otherwise, the tone feels spot-on.\",\n",

       " (\"I just lost my Samsung 46 inch top of the line when after only 3 years the picture developed a bad screen. Broke my heart but I realized even Samsung gets bad parts now and then. It's a good TV otherwise http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B0071NWYP8  I take super care of my electronics as I kept this LCD in new condition right up to its death. Three years? I told the Samsung rep on the phone. He just said it was out of warranty, so long story short I decided against another Samsung.  The vizio rep happened to be there and he pointed out that they re-vamped all the smart apps and told me of the new back-lit 12 panel led zone, which even the 2013 high tech &#34;M&#34; series didn't have. After fiddling with the contrast and temp colors I was able to get a fantastic picture.Bought it, brought it home and set it up.Wow! I was pretty impressed to find a $700 TV that can go up against a $1500 TV. And then you toss in a referbished TV for $500 and you've got yourself a deal! http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00SSG0AJO  Vizio also now has a smaller front frame edge measureing 10mm. only 2 mm less than last year but it makes for an almost invisable frame. Another bonus... I had a good experience mounting it with this http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B000WYVBR0  I did a solid week of reading reviews and numerous visits to my local stores watching and adjusting several brands before deciding on a 55 inch LG or Vizio as my choices. I hated the new LG's magic remote( works like a mouse on the screen) but I also heard that the Vizio had lame apps on their smart E & the better M series.  Just last week I walked into my local &#34;S&#34; club and a guy was setting up the new 2014 E series B-2. He told me they were the first to get them.  Vizio ups the speaker wattage from 10 to 15 watts. Not mindblowing but way improved from the muffled speaker sound that is associated with most down pointed speakers that seems to be standard with most HGTV's. Bottom line I love it. Its good to see a company like Vizio upping their game with internal improvements instead of a cosmetic makeover like a lot of other companies.  Save some cash, get yourself a good as new TV! http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00SSG0AJO\",\n",

My overall experience has been excellent and this drive, so far, is no exception.<br /><br />After a week with the WD2003FZEX my first impressions are below. I'll update the review as I've lived with the drive for a while and share what I learn.<br /><br />I installed the WD2003FZEX 2TB WD Black drive into a Dell T7500 Precision Workstation. It is being used for data and is not the boot drive which is a [[ASIN:B00CKAOWB6 Seagate 600 series SSD]] that is very fast but power hungry for a SSD: good for desktops, not as much for laptops/tablets.<br /><br />I tried both the built-in SATA2 and an add-in card with SATA3. In all cases Installation was painless and uneventful. The different interfaces did not yield dramatically different results.<br /><br />To get an handle on how this drive's performance changes from the last version I ran some tests on this drive and a older [[ASIN:B004CSIFFS Caviar Black 750 GB SATA III 7200 RPM 64MB - WD7502AAEX]] for comparison.<br /><br />In running casual tests (copying large files, directories of small files, etc.) I got some general impressions of the drive:<br /><br />1) In both large files and small file copies to/from the FZEX outperforms the older AAEX but mostly shines with small file/random access. I believe the improvement for small file/random access is close to 10%. Some of this might be the dual processor and improved caching over older versions.<br /><br />2) it's more noisy than previous versions as has been noted in other reviews. It seems that is a fairly consistent pattern for rotating media drives: faster=noisier.<br /><br />3) The drive runs slightly warm - meaning comfortably warm to the touch. Good for longevity and unusual for a performance drive.<br /><br />The WD Black line of drives comes with a 5 year warranty. I have had few failues with WD drives but when they have happened I have never had a problem with warranty. This has not been so true with other manufacturers (You can read about this in my review of the [[ASIN:B00691WMJG Seagate Momentus XT 750GB Hybrid Drive]]). With a business where I run a lot of hard drives this matters. Warranty is nothing until you need it, then it's everything.<br /><br />The FZEX is a consistent step in the long evolution and ongoing improvement of the WD Black line drives. For consistent quality I have to give this drive 5 stars.<br /><br />Hope this paints a helpful picture of what the drive delivers.<br /><br />Update: Dec 27, 2013<br /><br />After living with the 2TB black drive for a while it seems more quiet than at first. This might be the drive, but I think more likely me just getting used to it. So far no issues or glitches. It is operating perfectly and still feels faster than my older WD Black line drives. I'm still quite satisfied.<br /><br />Another option from WD that is a little unusual and works in laptops and may also be good for compact desktops or all-in-one's is the [[ASIN:B00GSJ9X4Q Black2 Dual Drive 2.5&#34; 120 GB SSD + 1 TB HDD]]. This provides an OS sized 120GB SSD and 1TB HDD in one laptop sized package. This is different from hybrid drives. It uses one 2.5&#34; format package to implement the popular desktop combo of a SSD for the OS and a conventional drive for bulk data. It's on the expensive side but is a good solution for a combination of speed and bulk data. I installed this for a client who does video editing on a laptop.\",\n",

(I found a very nice copy at a garage sale selling for a dollar, 50 cents after a bit of bargaining).<br /><br />This was reprinted by The University of Chicago Press with the following legend: &#34;The Snouters was originally published in Germany, under the title Bau und Leben der Rhinogradentia, by Gustav Fischer Verlag Stuttgart in 1957. Copyright � 1964 by Gustav Fischer Verlag Stuttgart. Portions of the book appeared in Natural History magazine in April 1967 and is reprinted here with permission. The 15 plates and 12 text figures in this volume were drawn by Gerolf Steiner. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago 60637 The University of Chicago Press, Ltd., London.<br /><br />Maggie Koerth-Baker recently wrote a blog post about the book; the picture she refers to can be found by googling Maggie Koerth-Baker imaginary animals.<br /><br />&#34;In this dusty display box at the University of Maine sits the carefully preserved skeleton of a small, shrew-like rodent which, lacking hind legs, propelled itself along with the help of a long, jointed nose-foot. If that seems a bit too whimsical to be true, well, it is. The creature belongs to the mammalian order Rhinogradentia – an entirely made-up class of animals. Like this specimen, which belongs to UMaine professor Irving Kornfield, the rhinogrades are all rodents and they all have some sort of fantastic nasal appendage ... and, most importantly, none of them actually exist.<br /><br />&#34;Now, there are plenty of imaginary animals in the world and, some of them – like the jackalope, for instance – exist in taxidermy and skeletal form despite not existing as living beings. But most of those are folk-crafts, their origins steeped in tall tales or intentionally profitable efforts to mislead, and their inventors lost to time. Rhinogradentia, on the other hand, is relatively new. It was created in 1961 by a real German zoologist named Gerolf Steiner who wanted to illustrate the way evolution can create diversity in isolated populations. In order to do that, Steiner created a fake German zoologist called Harald Stümpke, a fake island chain called Hy-yi-yi, and a fake order of mammals with funny noses. And then he wrote a book about it.<br /><br />&#34; Published under Stümpke's name, The Snouters: Form and Life of the Rhinogrades, is meant to read like a totally serious zoology handbook of the time period. It's a parody that absolutely refuses to wink at you, and it's become a bit of an in-joke among biologists. This particular specimen was actually built by Kornfield, himself, using real animal bones and illustrations from Stümpke/Steiner's book.&#34;<br /><br />I enjoyed reading the book, and enjoyed reading both Maggie Koerth-Baker's description and the marvelous Reviews here on Amazon even more. My only problem is how to dispose of the book, now that I am down sizing my life.<br /><br />Robert C. Ross<br />March 2015\",\n",
